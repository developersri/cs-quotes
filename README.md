The project is focused towards presenting a famous computer science quote picked from a fixed pool and allows voting on it by the user. If the quote is rated highly (i.e., rated above or equal to 4 out of 5), the system tries to find a **lexically and sentimentally** similar quote from the same pool and present it next. If the quote is disliked (i.e., rated 1 out of 5), the system goes on to find a **lexically and sentimentally** distant quote to be presented next.
